         <h2>Coffee Bean Type</h2>
         <p>The four main types of coffee beans are Arabica, Robusta, Liberica, and Excelsa. Each type has distinct characteristics that affect the flavor, aroma, and overall profile of the coffee. Here's an overview of each type:</p>
         <h3>- Arabica (Coffea arabica)</h3>
         <h4>Flavor Profile:</h4><p>Arabica beans tend to have a wide range of flavors, often described as sweet, fruity, and aromatic. They can also have hints of chocolate and nuts.</p>
         <h4>Acidity:</h4><p>Typically high, which contributes to their bright and tangy flavor.</p>
         <h4>Caffeine Content:</h4><p>Lower than Robusta.</p>
         <h4>Growing Conditions:</h4><p>Grown at higher altitudes (600-2,000 meters), mostly in Latin America, Africa, and some parts of Asia.</p>
         <h4>Popularity:</h4><p>The most popular type, making up about 60-70% of the worldâ€™s coffee production.</p>

         <h3>- Robusta (Coffea canephora)</h3>
         <h4>Flavor Profile:</h4><p>Often described as strong, harsh, and bitter with earthy and nutty notes. It lacks the complexity of Arabica.</p>
         <h4>Acidity:</h4><p>Lower acidity compared to Arabica.</p>
         <h4>Caffeine Content:</h4><p>Higher than Arabica, which gives it a stronger, more bitter taste.</p>
         <h4>Growing Conditions:</h4><p>Grows at lower altitudes (sea level to 800 meters), mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
         <h4>Popularity:</h4><p>Second most common type, making up about 30-40% of global production. Often used in espresso blends for its crema-enhancing properties.</p>
         <h3>- Liberica (Coffea liberica)</h3>
         <h4>Flavor Profile:</h4><p>Unique with a smoky, woody, and floral aroma. It can have a somewhat fruity or nutty taste.</p>
         <h4>Acidity:</h4><p>Moderate to low.</p>
         <h4>Caffeine Content:</h4><p>Similar to Robusta, but can vary.</p>
         <h4>Growing Conditions:</h4><p>Mainly grown in the Philippines, Malaysia, and West Africa.</p>
         <h4>Popularity: </h4><p>Less common and often considered an acquired taste due to its distinctive flavor</p>
         
        
         <h3>- Excelsa (Coffea excelsa or Coffea liberica var. dewevrei)</h3>
         <h4>Flavor Profile:</h4><p>Tart and fruity with a complex, somewhat mysterious flavor profile. It can be described as both light and dark, with a unique balance of sweet and tart notes.</p>
         <h4>Acidity:</h4><p>High.</p>
         <h4>Caffeine Content:</h4><p>Moderate.</p>
         <h4>Growing Conditions:</h4><p>Grown in Southeast Asia, often at medium altitudes.</p>
         <h4>Popularity: </h4><p>Rare and often used in blends to enhance the complexity of the coffee.</p>
